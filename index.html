        <h2>Entrepreneur & Programmer</h2>
        <p>Mid-way through university, I decided to pursue a career in Sailing. For four years, I travelled the world on numerous different sailing yachts.</p>
        <p>During my travels, I came across a product which gave me an idea which I thought would be ideal for the South African market. I am now giving the startup life a crack and it's going as expected - a rollercoaster ride.</p>
        <p>When I started my company, I immediately took on more of a technical role and was forced to learn multiple concepts quickly. I figured it was time to improve my knowledge of code and become more of an asset to the technical side of my company.</p>
